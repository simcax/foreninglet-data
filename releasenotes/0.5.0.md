## Release Notes - Version 0.5.0

### New Features

#### API Reliability Improvements
- **Retry Mechanism**: Added robust retry functionality to API calls using the `retry` library
  - Automatically retries on connection errors, timeouts, and HTTP errors (500, 502, etc.)
  - Configurable retry behavior: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
  - 60-second timeout per request to prevent hanging
  - Graceful error handling with detailed logging

#### New Member Analytics
- **`count_members_under_25`**: New method to count members aged 25 and under
  - Handles missing or invalid birthday data gracefully
  - Accessible via `memberlist_obj.count_members_under_25` attribute

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Module-level Caching**: Implemented sophisticated caching system for activities and memberships
  - Reduces test execution time from 36+ minutes to ~35 seconds
  - Caches API responses at module level to avoid repeated calls
  - Includes cache clearing functionality for testing scenarios
  - Uses `@lru_cache` for activities API with 1280 entry limit

### Infrastructure & Development

#### Package Management Migration
- **uv Integration**: Complete migration from Poetry to modern `uv` package manager
  - Converted `pyproject.toml` to PEP 621 compliant format
  - Updated all development workflows and CI scripts
  - Improved dependency resolution and installation speed

#### CI/CD Pipeline Modernization
- **Dagger CI**: Implemented containerized CI pipeline using Dagger v0.19.8
  - Version compatibility resolved between Dagger CLI and Python SDK
  - Comprehensive testing in isolated Python 3.13 containers
  - Automated code formatting checks with Black (excluding generated SDK files)
  - Coverage reporting with pytest-cov
- **Dual CI Approach**: Both containerized (Dagger) and local (shell script) CI options
  - `dagger-ci.py`: Full containerized pipeline for consistent environments
  - `ci.sh`: Local development script for quick validation

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 35 tests passing
  - API retry functionality thoroughly tested with mocked scenarios
  - Connection error, timeout, and HTTP error retry testing
  - Performance regression testing with timing assertions
  - 96% test coverage maintained

#### Development Tools
- **VCR Anonymization**: Advanced data anonymization tools for test fixtures
  - `anonymize_fl_api_data.py` script for sanitizing API response data
  - Faker integration with Danish locale for realistic fake data
  - Comprehensive field anonymization (names, addresses, emails, phones)
  - Activity ID randomization while maintaining data structure

### Dependencies Updated

#### Added Dependencies
- **`retry>=0.9.2`**: API retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **`dagger-io>=0.19.8`**: Containerized CI/CD pipeline (updated from 0.11.9)

#### Development Dependencies
- Updated development toolchain for uv compatibility
- Enhanced testing framework with performance optimizations

### Bug Fixes
- **API Stability**: Resolved intermittent connection issues with retry mechanism
- **Test Performance**: Fixed extremely long test execution times through caching
- **CI Reliability**: Resolved Dagger version compatibility issues causing schema errors
- **Code Formatting**: Fixed Black formatter conflicts with generated SDK files

### Technical Details
- **Python Compatibility**: Maintains support for Python >=3.11
- **API Timeout**: Standardized 60-second timeout for all API requests  
- **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling with detailed error messages
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized member data processing for large organizations

### Migration Notes
- Projects using this library will benefit from improved API reliability automatically
- No breaking changes to existing API interfaces
- Cache warming may cause slightly slower first run, then significant speed improvements
- Development environments should migrate to uv for optimal experience

### Performance Improvements
- **Test Execution**: 95%+ reduction in test suite runtime (36+ minutes → ~35 seconds)
- **API Resilience**: Automatic recovery from transient network issues
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures and caching strategies
- **CI Speed**: Containerized builds with layer caching for faster iterations

This release represents a major stability and performance improvement while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing code.
