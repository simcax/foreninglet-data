### Code changes

#### Activity API
The activity API is now accessed in order to identify memberships, and add the membership name to the individual members

* New Activity model (dataclass)
* Added new Activities Class
    * This can hold all the activites and gives a map of the activity id's to activity names 
* 

#### Memberlist / Members
In order to get the member model to contain the membership name, it has been refactored to a Pydantic model. In addition the member model was previously placed in the fl_types.py file, and has been refactored to a new `models` subfolder. This way the code is better organized. 
The new model file is called `member_model.py`

* Member model refactored to pydantic model
    * The fields are now more optional than required
    * The phone number and mobile number now allows for country codes
    * There is now no longer any mocking code in the model
        * The mocking used in testing is moved to the MockMember class under tests

#### Packages

*Added*
* pydantic 
* pytest

*Moved*
* pytest-vcr --> to dev dependencies


#### Test code

* MockMember refactored to use the new Member model
* Added a method to generate test data for the MockMember class
* Refactored tests to get all use of the vcr and pytest-vcr out of production code, and only be used in the tests
